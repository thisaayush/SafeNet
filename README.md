# SafeNet - Basic Incognito Browser 

SafeNet is the most basic broswer you would ever use! I named it SafeNet as it doesn't collects any information of your browsing, even locally! 
It serves you a fully Incognito Browsing Experience! You can do and search what ever you want! i will not get you data ;)

It uses basic android functionalities like Webview, layouts, animation, etc 

I hope you will learn something just by going though the code!
