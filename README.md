# SafeNet - Basic Incognito Browser 

SafeNet is the most basic browser you would ever use! I named it SafeNet as it doesn't collect any information about your browsing, even locally! It serves you a fully Incognito Browsing Experience! You can do and search for whatever you want! I will not get you data ;)

It uses basic android functionalities like Webview, layouts, animation, etc

I hope you will learn something just by going through the code! You can also clone it and change it according to your preferences!
